Matrix computation finds applications in many fields such as signal processing, numerical analysis, artificial intelligence, quantum mechanics, and more. In this project, we will design a 32x32 matrix computation unit. Each matrix element is 8 bits, and the unit contains a total of four computation units. Therefore, for each operation, it can handle four multiplications simultaneously.
